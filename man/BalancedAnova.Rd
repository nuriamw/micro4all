\title{Execute balanced ANOVA for multiple indexes}
\usage{
BalancedAnova(data, numberOfIndexes, formula, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame, columns corresponding to indexes and rows
corresponding to samples. Further columns should be included with metadata.
This is used for Formula as a grouping factor.}

\item{numberOfIndexes}{Integer corresponding to the number of indexes to
analyze. This will be take as column numbers by the function.}

\item{formula}{Metadata group name. This will group samples according to a
metadata column and specify the model.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{aov}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of two elements. First element is a data frame,
containing the summary statistics from \code{aov} on different indexes (indexes
names are shown in the IndexColumn). Second element is a list, composed of
as many list as indexes were analyzed. These contain the complete results
from \code{aov}.
}
\description{
This function fits an analysis of variance model (ANOVA) for
various indexes. Input must be a table with indexes as columns and samples
as rows. Further columns should include metadata.

\examples{

balanced_anova_rhizo<- BalancedAnova(alpha_indexes_rhizo, numberOfIndexes = 4, formula = "Management")
